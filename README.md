# MesaÂ Subgraph

Mesa Subgraph is the main provider for Mesa Interface data.

# Architecture

**Fixed Contracts**

The subgraph listens for events from three fixed contracts; they are deployed once:

1. `MesaFactory`
2. `AuctionLauncher`
3. `MesaFactory`

**Dynamic Contracts**

These contracts are deployed from the factory for every new auction. Their address is resolved from `Event.address` and compared against `MesaFactory.allAuctions` array. If the address does not belong to Mesa's auction, the handler does an early exit:

1. `EasyAuction`
2. `FixedPriceAuction`

## Contracts

### `MesaFactory`

<sub>[`src/mappings/factory.ts`](src/mappings/factory.ts)</sub>

#### 1. `TemplateLaunched`

Emitted when `MesaFactory.launchTemplate` is called. Returns:

```typescript
interface TemplateLaunchedParams {
  // Address of the new Auction: EasyAuction or FixedPriceAuction
  auction: string
  // The template ID of the auction type: EasyAuction or FixedPriceAuction
  templateId: string
}
```

`templateId` is used to determine GraphQL schema -- either `EasyAuction` or `FixedPriceAuction` -- to create. `auction` address is the address of the newly deploed auction contract.

### `AuctionLauncher`

<sub>[`src/mappings/auctionLauncher.ts`](src/mappings/auctionLauncher.ts)</sub>

WIP

### `TemplateLauncher`

<sub>[`src/mappings/templateLauncher.ts`](src/mappings/templateLauncher.ts)</sub>

WIP

### `EasyAuction`

<sub>[`src/mappings/auctions/easyAuction.ts`](src/mappings/auctions/easyAuction.ts)

### `FixedPriceAuction`

<sub>[`src/mappings/auctions/fixedPriceAuction.ts`](src/mappings/auctions/fixedPriceAuction.ts)</sub>

## GraphQL Entities

These entities are available in the subgraph. Schemas are in [`schema.graphql`](schema.graphql)

### MesFactory

One entity to retrieve information about the factory

### EasyAuction

All auction of type EasyAuction

### FixedPriceAuction

All auction of type FixedPriceAuction

### AuctionTemplate

Registerd auction mechansims in `TemplateLauncher` contract

# Installation

Install dependencies using `yarn`

```bash
$ yarn
```

# Deployment

## Set up config file

Each network deployment requires setting up a JSON configuration file in `config/<NetworkName>.json`. For instance, for Rinkeby, the file

## Prepare `subgraph.yaml`

`subgraph.yaml` is built from `subgraph.template.yaml` using configuration defined in previous section. To do so, run

```bash
$ npm run prepare:<NetworkName>
```

Current available networks are Mainnet and Rinkeby.

## Deploy to The Graph

Read documentations for [installing The Graph CLI](https://thegraph.com/docs/quick-start#3.-initialize-a-new-subgraph), then run

```bash
$ npm run deploy
```

# Build ABIs

ABIs for main contracts are not included in the repo. Instead, they are extracted from the smart contract repo ([cryptonative-ch/mesa-smartcontracts](https://github.com/cryptonative-ch/mesa-smartcontracts)). To build the ABIs, run:

```bash
$ ./build-abis.sh
```

Note that it requires [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) tool.

# Tests

Tests require [Docker](http://docker.com/) installed. To run tests, run

```bash
$ yarn tests
```

# Scripts

This projects comes with a set of predefined scripts in `package.json`
